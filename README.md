# Rename.ps1
Powershell script to rename files with a chosen extension (in my case adding .tiff to scanned files created without extensions)

# How to use
Copy files that need to be renamed into the images folder

Run the rename.bat in the root folder

Files in the images folder should now have a .tiff extension
